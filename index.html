        Currently I work at a primary care doctors office as a patient services representative. I am the first person 
            patients connect with prior to seeing their doctor. I come from a family of four. We moved to Indiana 10 years
            ago from the state of Vermont. I like Indiana a lot better. I live in a house with my dog, Leo, a goldendoodle. 
            We go on hikes and adventures as much as we can. Every year I try to take time to travel. I have been to diffrent
            parts of Europe, Canada, and last year I visit the Dominican Republic. My goal is to travel as much as I can
            and want to explore all 50 States in the US. Hope you enjoy this lovely picture of Leo.

                    My name is Alec Perkins and I am 22 years old. I work as an Inventory Specialist in a warehouse for reading
                    glasses, while trying to get through school. In my free time, I like to spend time with my girlfriend, Jessica.
                    I also have two dogs, a lab/pit mix named Roshe and a beagle mix named Presto. I also love to play video
                    games. My favorites include NBA 2k, Madden, and Call of Duty. I also love to play/watch football and basketball.
                    My favorite teams are the Minnesota Vikings and Miami Heat.
