                <p>
                    My name is Alec Perkins and I am 22 years old. I work as an Inventory Specialist in a warehouse for reading
                    glasses, while trying to get through school. In my free time, I like to spend time with my girlfriend, Jessica.
                    I also have two dogs, a lab/pit mix named Roshe and a beagle mix named Presto. I also love to play video
                    games. My favorites include NBA 2k, Madden, and Call of Duty. I also love to play/watch football and basketball.
                    My favorite teams are the Minnesota Vikings and Miami Heat.
