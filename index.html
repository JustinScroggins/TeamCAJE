        <h3>Emina</h3>
        <p>Currently I work in a doctors office as a patient service representative. Someone who connects with patients prior to them coming to the doctor.
            I live in a house with my dog, Leo, a goldendoodle. I love to go on hikes with Leo and take him on adventures. I come from a family of four.
            I lived in the state of Vermont for 10 years before moving to Indiana. I have come to like Indiana a lot more.
            Every year I try to make time to travel outside the country. I have been to different parts of Europe, Canada, and last year I visited Dominican Republic.
            I would like to travel more within the states. Included is a picture of my dog. Just want you to enjoy that lovely photo.
