        Currently I work at a primary care doctors office as a patient services representative. I am the first person 
            patients connect with prior to seeing their doctor. I come from a family of four. We moved to Indiana 10 years
            ago from the state of Vermont. I like Indiana a lot better. I live in a house with my dog, Leo, a goldendoodle. 
            We go on hikes and adventures as much as we can. Every year I try to take time to travel. I have been to diffrent
            parts of Europe, Canada, and last year I visit the Dominican Republic. My goal is to travel as much as I can
            and want to explore all 50 States in the US. Hope you enjoy this lovely picture of Leo.
